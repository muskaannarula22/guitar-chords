			<u> WHY TAB NOTATION </u>
		</p>
		<p> 
			To play string instruments like the guitar, ukulele or 
			even bass, tab notation is usually enough. It is a rather 
			straightforward approach to understanding the orientation of 
			the left hand. You can literally mimic the shape shown to 
			determine the orientation your hand needs to be. So, for all 
			you visual learners out there, TAB IS YOUR BEST FRIEND. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			The issue with sheet music is that it's not perfectly 
			translatable onto the guitar (each of the guitar frets is a 
			half-step while the distance between each note in the musical 
			alphabet varies). When you look at the alphabet on a piano, 
			they are all nicely organized because of the black keys (as 
			shown in the picture of the piano below). But when it is put 
			on the guitar (also shown below, it gets all fumbled up and 
			confusing... unless you're willing to memorize that is. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			Otherwise, Tab Notes are a wonderful start! And as you expand 
			your musical knowledge, definitely look into adapting to sheet 
			music. It will help you better understand the formation of 
			music and scales, chord progressions and such.

			<u> READING TAB NOTATION </u>
		</p>
		<p> 
			When showing the shape of a chord, this is the tab 
			notation that is used. Each of the vertical lines 
			represents a string from the guitar. The left most 
			string is the top most string on the guitar. It is also 
			the lowest string.  The top-most guitar string is also 
			called the 6th string and the bottom-most highest string 
			is called the 1st string.

			<u> TABS WITH MELODIES </u>
		</p>
		<p> 
			Often times, you will see sheet music accompanied with 
			tab notes. Again, the concept is the same as above. 
			The 1st (bottom most string on the guitar) is the top 
			most line on the notes. And 6th string is the top most 
			on the guitar but bottom most on the tab. The is because 
			the lines on the tab notes is organized from highest to 
			lowest, but on the guitar, it is lowest to highest when 
			going top to bottom. It's wordy, I know. The numbers 
			represent the fret you should have your finger on when 
			plucking it. 0 means open string. Sometimes, you'll see 
			three notes all in one row. This means you should play 
			all three strings at once. I'd recommend always playing 
			the top most one with your thumb and the rest with your 
			other fingers. The example below is the beginning melody 
			of Jingle Bells. Feel free to practice tabs with it!
