			 WHAT IS GUITAR-CHORDS 
		</p>
		<p> 
			So you've decided you want to learn the guitar! That's 
			great and all, but how do you know where to begin? 
			Starting anything new is challenging as it is, given 
			all the new things you have to learn and learning about 
			all the new things you need to know. 
 		</p> 
		<p>
			If you're in a similar situation, you've come to the 
			right place! When I picked up the guitar, I had no idea 
			where to even begin. But as I became more familiar with 
			music theory, I was better able to figure A LOT. This 
			website has all the information you would need to 
			practice your guitar playing skills.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 18pt">
			RHYTHM VS. LEAD
		</p>
		<p> 
			There are two main styles of guitar playing: lead and 
			rhythm. Lead guitar involves the guitar playing that 
			"drives" the music. It's the melody that makes the 
			song distinctly memorable and is only playing in parts 
			of the song where there is no singing. Rhythm guitar 
			refers to the supporting chords and provides a backdrop 
			to the singer. I will be focusing mostly on rhythm playing.
			 While most people want to practice lead guitar, it's important 
			 not to forget to learn rhythm. You can always play a song 
			 without the lead, but never without the rhythm. 
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 18pt">
			TAB NOTATION 
		</p>
		<p> 
			The base of any rhythm playing are chords. Once you have 
			mastered pressing down strings, and plucking melodies on the 
			bottom three strings, you're ready to learn a couple chords. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			The best way to show the alignment of chords is with Tab Notes. 
			While understanding sheet music enhances your understanding of 
			music, most guitarists use tabs to learn chords. Its notation 
			shows the shape of the chord which can be very helpful with 
			memorization.  
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 18pt">
			NAVIGATION
		</p>
		<p> 
			If you are not familiar with Tab Notes or need a quick review, 
			you can get more information under it on the Tab section.  
		</p>
		<p> 
			In the chords section, you will find information on the actual 
			chords most commonly used in songs along with various ways you 
			could add style and depth to your playing. It is organized from 
			easiest to more difficult. It is in the general order that I 
			learnt my chords. Hope you find this useful!   
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 12pt"> 
			NOTE: This website is still in progress and if information is 
			lacking, it is probably because I am in the process of putting 
			it all together.
